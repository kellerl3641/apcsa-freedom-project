### Content:

I have officially completed my year-long project of creating a password generator and saver using Java Swing. I have used funny sound effects such as oinking, snorting, and loud sets of booming to emphasize the key aspect of having it Peppa Pig Themed. To showcase my work to those around me, I decided to present my project to the class, where I demonstrated my final product and learned about the small adjustments I could make to it.

### Sources
Some resources that I've used during the final process of my project are going to be my tiny notebook full of notes, because I prefer to handwrite notes. I forget the main functionality of basic `For loops` now due to not practicing enough, and I needed the loop to access the set of alphabets in my array. The second resource that I've used is Google. I had a pretty rough time trying to figure out why my sound effect was working in my whole computer when I ran the code for a few days, because I thought it was a slight internal malfunction.....it was not, however. I had forgotten to include the correct path to my sound effects somehow, and that affected how my sound effects were coming up, which explains the whole reason for it not to display.
### Engineering Design Process:
I'm currently on the last step of the Engineering Design Process because I have officially finished my project. However, when I was running the code, sometimes my sound effects would not pop up on each click, and my main issue was the music cutting out midway. And I was a little bit confused because I don't exactly recall changing up my code at all. I debugged quickly and realized that my problem was in the section where I can choose the different types of looping I want the music to be in. I chose just the loop, and it resulted in only 1-2 loops on random instead of looping for the whole time. After I resolved that issue, I had nothing else to worry about, and my sound effects were running perfectly. 


### Skills
Given the opportunity to present in class about my project, code, designs, and challenges I had learned how to speak in front of the whole class with confidence, making sure everyone could understand my section of code that I wasn't sure at first with too, and making me notice that it's okay to make mistake along the way because that's how you learn. Furthermore, I believe that one major skill I learned throughout this whole project and presentation is opening your mouth. I used to be afraid to ask for questions and tell my teacher what's going on with my code, and that made me behind in my classes majority of the time. I believe that this project has helped me grow as a person and has shaped me to understand more hardships.
