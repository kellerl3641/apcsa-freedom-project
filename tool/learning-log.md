# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **SWING**

## Project: **Creating a password generator and saver**

---

### 10/03/24:
I decided that I wanted to create a password generator and saver because I tend to forget my passwords. I also chose to learn Swing because it seems very straightforward and fun. I did some basic research on Swing and the "key points" of Swing.

**Swing**
- Java's standard library
- Uses components inside `javax.swing` package
- provides components needed for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- Built on top of AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
- Offers a wider variety of components
**Notes to know**
- Swing is not dependent on the native platform's GUI componenets. (Allows for flexibility)
- Allows developers to customize the looks of GUI components.
- Create custom themes.
- Includes buttons, text fields, tables, trees, menus, etc.
- Handles user interfaces such as button clicks, mousemovements, trigger events and other event handling.
**Some other stuff that I haven't figured out are**
- SwingUtilities: I assume this is a class in Swing that provies methods that can help during GUI production? (not sure yet, will dig deeper)
- Support for MVC (Model-View-Controller).
- "Model" is for design patterns and separating the data.
- User interface is the "View".
- Control logic of the application is "Controller"

(Will continue digging)

### Example of a Simple Swing Application:
a basic example that creates a simple GUI with a button and a label using Swing:

```java
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JLabel;
import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class SimpleSwingApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a frame
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Simple Swing Application");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(300, 200);

        // Create a panel
        JPanel panel = new JPanel();

        // Create a label
        JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello, Swing!");

        // Create a button
        JButton button = new JButton("Click Me");
        button.addActionListener(e -> label.setText("Button Clicked!"));

        // Add components to the panel
        panel.add(label);
        panel.add(button);

        // Add panel to the frame
        frame.add(panel);

        // Set the frame visible
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

The code above is a short button that displays "Click me" and then add frames after the user interacts with it. <br>
In short, the Swing application can be made into anything interactive.

I was planning out my tool and started on the basic set up of SWING library importment and all of them require
```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
```
import javax.swing.; imports all the classes from the javax.swing package, which are used for creating the graphical user interface components like JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, and JButton.<br>
import java.awt.; imports all the classes from the java.awt package, which are used for layout management and creating the graphical user interface. <br>
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; imports the ActionEvent class, which represents an action event.<br>
import java.awt.event.ActionListener; imports the ActionListener interface, which is used for receiving action events. <br>
import java.security.SecureRandom; imports the SecureRandom class, which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator.

I will begin creating classes next class and learning how to set class.

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
- [ ] Create a new Java project in your IDE.
- [ ] Import the required packages: `javax.swing`, `java.awt`, `java.util`.

#### **Phase 2: Design the User Interface**
- [ ] Create a `JFrame` window.
- [ ] Add these components:
   - `JLabel` for instructions.
   - `JTextField` for entering website and username.
   - `JPasswordField` for entering or displaying the password.
   - `JButton` for **Save**, **Generate Password**, and **Copy to Clipboard**.
   - `JTable` to display saved passwords.
- [ ] Arrange the layout using `JPanel` and `GridLayout`.

#### **Phase 3: Password Generation**
- [ ] Write a method to generate random passwords using:
   - A combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
   - Example: `"ABCabc123!@#"`
- [ ] Let the password appear in the password field when the **Generate Password** button is clicked.

#### **Phase 4: Save and Display Passwords**
- [ ] Store credentials using an `ArrayList` or `HashMap`.
- [ ] Display saved passwords in the `JTable`.
- [ ] Make sure each entry includes:
   - Website name
   - Username
   - Password

#### **Phase 5: Event Handling (Button Clicks)**
- [ ] **Save Button:** Save the entered details to the list and update the table.
- [ ] **Generate Button:** Call the password generation method.
- [ ] **Copy to Clipboard Button:** Copy the generated password to the clipboard using `Toolkit`.

#### **Phase 6: File Saving (Optional)**
- [ ] Save passwords to a text file (`.txt`) using `FileWriter`.
- [ ] Load data from the file when the app starts.

The next step would be to start on part one

I have officially finished my MVP and am ready to move along to my beyond MVP.... Here are some things that I planned to change that could make my app way more flexible and silly.
‚úÖ = Accomplished
‚ùé = Have not yet accomplished

List of extra features that will be added:
- [‚ùé] Prevents any signs of duplicate passwords (To match the authenticity of an actual password saver)
- [‚ùé] Clear saved passwords: Deletes all passwords from the screen and file when you press the Clear Button.
- [‚ùé] Cute sound effects: Plays oink.wav, save.wav, load.wav, clear.wav when the user interacts with the buttons.
- [‚ùé] Background music: Plays peppa_theme.wav on a loop when the window pops out!
- [‚ùé] Peppa Pig popups: Cute Peppa images pop up when you click buttons (After saving)
- [‚ùé] Simple confirmation popups: Always show popups like "Saved! üéÄ", "Cleared! üßπ" after each action


Important files that I keep in mind for later:
- Images files that pop up when the user clicks the different buttons: peppa1.png, peppa2.png, peppa3.png
- - Background Sounds file: peppa_theme.wav
- Sound Effect Files: oink.wav, save.wav, load.wav, clear.wav
